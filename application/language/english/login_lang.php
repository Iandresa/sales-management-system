<p>
IANDRESA was created to provide a Sales Management System for any business premises in order to support the business management of enterprises.
</p>
<p>
Currently in the market there are a number of services for management of commercial shops which are expensive and isolated, where most of these are physically in each commercial which does not allow remote administration.
</p>
<p>
Besides, other Sales Management Systems do not offer the possibility to administer one or more shops that are in different physical areas or branches under the same management system.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, IANDRESA solve the problem mentioned above by delivering a Sales Management System under the concept of Cloud Computing, so that from any Internet-enabled device can manage and make necessary business decisions at the most opportune time.
</p>
<p>
In addition, IANDRESA can view and management one or more stores, regardless of where these are physically.
